    """
        Generate a full-text search query for a given input string.

        This function constructs a query string suitable for a full-text
        search. It processes the input string by splitting it into words and 
        appending a similarity threshold (~2 changed characters) to each
        word, then combines them using the AND operator. Useful for mapping
        entities from user questions to database values, and allows for some 
        misspelings.
